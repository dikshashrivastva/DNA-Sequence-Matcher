# DNA-Sequence-Matcher

A **web-based DNA sequence matcher** that uses the **Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP)** algorithm to efficiently find patterns within DNA strings. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this tool offers fast, accurate matching via a simple and intuitive interface—ideal for educational use or entry-level bioinformatics analysis.

##  Demo

*(Optional: Include a screenshot or GIF illustrating the user interface and matching results here.)*

##  Features

- **Efficient Pattern Matching**: Implements the KMP algorithm for O(n + m) time complexity, ensuring fast searches even with large input.
- **Interactive Web UI**: Paste or type DNA sequences and patterns directly into text fields and view match results instantly.
- **Pure Front-End**: No server-side processing—runs entirely in the browser for easy use and deployment.
- **Educational Value**: Helps users understand string-matching techniques applied to genetic sequences.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)

### Setup

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

---

##  Usage

1. Enter or paste the **DNA sequence** (text A/C/G/T).
2. Type the **pattern(s)** you want to search for (e.g., “AGCT”).
3. Click the **Search/Match** button.
4. View the match results—locations, counts, or highlighted matches (depending on implementation details).

*(Optional: Add a visual example or explanation of what output the user should expect.)*

##  How It Works

- The application implements the **Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP)** string-matching algorithm to efficiently search for patterns in the DNA sequence.
- Your web interface captures user input (sequence and pattern), runs the KMP algorithm via JavaScript, and displays results immediately on the page.
- This gives users an interactive experience to explore DNA sequence pattern matching in real time.
